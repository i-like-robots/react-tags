Whoever\n * instantiates a transaction can provide enforcers of the invariants at\n * creation time. The `Transaction` class itself will supply one additional\n * automatic invariant for you - the invariant that any transaction instance\n * should not be run while it is already being run. You would typically create a\n * single instance of a `Transaction` for reuse multiple times, that potentially\n * is used to wrap several different methods.
